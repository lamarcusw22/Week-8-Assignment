        I am a huge San Antonio Spurs fan and one the reasons is because of Tim Duncan. He's regarded as the greatest Power Forward to ever play. He was not known for being flashy or the most entertaining to watch but he was known for his fundementals and IQ for the game of basketball. He led the Spurs to 6 NBA finals appearances winning 5 of them.
