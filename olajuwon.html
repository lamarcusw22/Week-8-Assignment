        Hakeem Olajuwon was one of the main reasons I even like basketball. I remember watching him as a little kid and my older brother had a huge admiration for him which made watch a lot of his games. Hakeem is regarded as one of the best Centers ever winning two NBA Finals and One of 2 people to win MVP, Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season.
